# Development

Development on passgen happens at [GitLab][gitlab]. We are more than happy to accept [merge requests][merge-requests] there, especially from new contributors, and [bug reports][bug-reports] on the issue tracker. You may also use the [GitHub][github] project page, which is kept mostly in sync.

We use the amazing GitLab CI to test and build the code on every commit, for all of the platforms that we support. We (try to) have extensive unit tests, and we run them for every architecture that we support using the amazing QEMU project. We use the CI as well to generate signed nightly builds that are available on the [releases](releases.md) page.

We publish [Doxygen documentation][doxygen] for the source code, which is generated on every commit to master. Additionally, we also publish unit test code coverage generated by [lcov][coverage-lcov] and [llvm-cov][coverage-llvm-cov].

Passgen is written in C, consisting of a library and a command-line utility that uses the library. It can be easily embedded into other applications. Passgen does not use any global state, and as such it is safe to use from different threads. However, the parser can only be used from one thread at a time (it has no mutex to prevent errors from happening due to concurrent access).

Passgen uses the [CMake][cmake] build system, which allows it to be built on different platforms and with different compilers. However, only `gcc` and `clang` are officially supported and tested, as they are the most popular and versatile right now.
