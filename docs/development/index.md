# Resources

Development of Passgen happens at [GitLab][gitlab]. [Merge
requests][merge-requests] and [bug reports][bug-reports] are very welcome
there. These are some useful resources for development of passgen:

    Passgen uses [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to store code and run continuous integration and deployment jobs.

-   :material-file-document:{ .lg .middle } **Documentation**

    ---

    [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/)-generated source code documentation is available.

    [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) is used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Explanation][ci]

-   :material-test-tube:{ .lg .middle } **Test Coverage**

    ---

    As part of the CI/CD pipeline, test coverage reports are generated.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Coverage][coverage-lcov] (or: [LLVM cov][coverage-llvm-cov])

</div>

[GitLab CI][ci] is used to test and build the code on every commit, for all of
the platforms that are supported. [LLVM sanitizers][llvm-sanitizer] and
[valgrind][valgrind] are used to catch memory unsafety errors. [QEMU][qemu] is
used to execute all of the unit tests for all of the supported platforms.
Additionally, the CI generates SSH signatures for the nightly builds that are
also available for download at the [releases](../nightly.md) page.

!!! warning "Code coverage reports from llvm-cov are currently broken"

    The code coverage reports from llvm-cov are currently broken. They only
    show code coverage of the files of the test system, but not of passgen
    itself. I'm working on fixing that.

[Doxygen documentation][doxygen] is published for the source code on every
commit to the `master` branch. Finally, code coverage (as determined by the
unit tests) is generated by [lcov][coverage-lcov] and
[llvm-cov][coverage-llvm-cov], and published similarly (see the respective
links).

Passgen is written in C, consisting of a library and a command-line utility
that uses the library. It can be easily embedded into other applications.
Passgen does not use any global state, and as such it is safe to use from
different threads. However, the parser can only be used from one thread at a
time (it has no mutex to prevent errors from happening due to concurrent
access).

Passgen uses the [CMake][cmake] build system, allowing it to be built on
different platforms and with different compilers. However, only `gcc` and
`clang` are officially supported and tested, as those are used in the CI
builds.

You may also check out the [GitHub][github] project page, which is kept
somewhat in sync. If you are interested in an explainer of how to build
Passgen, check out the [Building](building.md) page.
