# To Do

## Current

- [ ] introduce `passgen_context` with wordlists, markov chains, allocation functions, etc.
- [ ] fix `abc|def[]()` parsing
- [ ] autogenerate debug methods
- [ ] write ast to string encoder (for easy testing)
- [ ] rename passgen pattern segment to passgen segment
- [ ] make symbols check work for shared library
- [ ] move building instructions into docs, document new options
- [ ] add optional wordlist support
- [ ] add optional markov support
- [ ] document `CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD` and adds to CI build
- [ ] remove special character handling in favour of (:english:) and [:english:] type syntax.
- [ ] version releases with signed tags, generate versions from that
- [ ] generate changelog page
- [ ] extensive benchmarks
- [ ] simplify data structures
- [ ] character class subtraction <https://www.regular-expressions.info/charclasssubtract.html>
- [ ] character class intersection <https://www.regular-expressions.info/charclassintersect.html>
- [ ] add character classes like `[::emoji::]` or `[::english::]`, parsed from `unicode-data` <https://www.regular-expressions.info/posixbrackets.html>, or `(:english:)` for wordlists?
- [ ] add regex subroutines <https://www.regular-expressions.info/subroutine.html>, maybe recursion?
- [ ] add randomness distribution options (normal distribution as `a{normal(4, 2)}`, give probabilities for each option `a{0:0.2;1:0.3;2:0.5}`).
- [ ] add parse tree conversion to regex for testing?
- [ ] add backreference support (with `\k` or to group)
- [ ] optional features: gzip wordlist, json, debug
- [ ] add building support for meson/makefile/other build systems
- [ ] lazy-load word lists
- [ ] remove any use of globals
- [ ] parsing error backtrace (using parsing stack)
- [ ] AST to JSON output (for debugging purposes)
- [ ] internationalisation (maybe)
- [ ] speed up generation (caching and batched encode)
- [ ] benchmark (simple)
- [ ] different syntax for special groups (maybe)
- [ ] disallow escaped when not necessary
- [ ] website passgen.it with markdown template
- [ ] windows builds, debian packages
- [ ] wordlist support (gzipped)
- [ ] markov chain loading support
- [ ] improve const-correctness (mark everything as const that is const).
- [ ] implement markov chain selection for parser and generator! major blocker
    for feature-parity with legacy parser.
- [ ] write more documentation (in docs/, manual, paper, update man page).
    - [ ] 20% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 30% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 40% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 50% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 60% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 70% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 80% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 90% documentation coverage
    - [ ] 90% documentation coverage
- [ ] document base API
- [ ] implement static memory methods
- [ ] make pronounceable take simple pointer to markov structure
- [ ] make word list generation work
- [ ] write script to check sizes of the various components by parsing `nm` output
- [ ] write tool to determine size of various data structures (using size, nm, objdump)
- [ ] add static assertions to check size of structs
- [ ] rearrange struct members to potentially save space?
- [ ] clean up data structures
- [ ] think about the syntax of special characters
- [ ] json generation for all data structures (autogenerated with pycparser?)
- [ ] remove legacy code
    - [ ] `pattern.c`
    - [ ] `pattern_random.c`
    - [ ] `pattern_presets.c`
- [ ] review code coverage and perhaps add more tests
    - [ ] 90% test coverage
    - [ ] 95% test coverage
    - [ ] 98% test coverage
    - [ ] 99% test coverage
- [ ] improve makeshift test framework (forking? shuffling? verbose/non-verbose mode?)
- [ ] add or think about memory handling
- [ ] reimplement memory handling, benchmark to make sure it doesn't affect performance too much
- [ ] adapt generation for new data structures
- [ ] write benchmark for new parser
- [ ] try changing parser state stack to linked list?
- [ ] implement stack depth limiting for new parser (as separate method)
- [ ] implement code profiling

## Ideas

- Unity build (better optimisation)
- Link-time optimisation
- CPack generate tarball, debian package, etc.

- rewrite the passgen parser to use batched operations, meaning that all
  all unicode should be parsed in one go, then all (or 128) tokens should
  be parsed at a time. but still allow it to be used in a streaming manner.
  this should be more optimal for speed and also just lead to cleaner code.
- make the data structures pretty. they should be maintainable, and optionally
  allow for JSON output for debugging
- write benchmarks to make sure that the parser is quick. that's the whole
  reason this is written in C, anyways.
- write a fuzzing backend, using AFL or the like, to ensure there are no bugs
  that can crash the parser.
- optimise the testing system, perhaps use another testing framework that is
  more actively maintained, test more edge cases and use macros to write clean
  tests.
- implement wordlist functionality (find a space-efficient way to store large
  word lists?)
