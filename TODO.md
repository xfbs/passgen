# ToDo

- [x] rewrite the token parser. it should be a state machine
- [x] test list autogeneration (done in `scripts/tests_generate.rb`)
- [x] enum mapping autogeneration (done in `scripts/generate_enum_mapping.rb`)
- [ ] json generation for all data structures (autogenerated with pycparser?)
- [x] move all `include/passgen/pattern/*.h` data structures into `include/passgen/data/`.
- [ ] remove legacy code
- [ ] add or think about memory handling
- [ ] enable memory sanitizer for tests
- [ ] rewrite the parser, it should be a state machine
    - [x] implement group parsing
    - [x] implement set parsing
    - [x] implement set range parsing
    - [x] implement repeat parsing
    - [ ] implement escape handling
    - [ ] implement special character handling
- [ ] adapt generation for new data structures
- [ ] write benchmark for new parser
- [ ] try changing parser state stack to linked list?
- [ ] implement stack depth limiting for new parser (as separate method)
- [x] rename array to queue or stack
    - [ ] move all uses of array over to stack
- [x] implement type specialisations for array data type
- [ ] squash compiler warnings
    - [x] get rid of easy ones
    - [ ] get rid of all


- rewrite the passgen parser to use batched operations, meaning that all
  all unicode should be parsed in one go, then all (or 128) tokens should
  be parsed at a time. but still allow it to be used in a streaming manner.
  this should be more optimal for speed and also just lead to cleaner code.
- make the data structures pretty. they should be maintainable, and optionally
  allow for JSON output for debugging
- write benchmarks to make sure that the parser is quick. that's the whole
  reason this is written in C, anyways.
- write a fuzzing backend, using AFL or the like, to ensure there are no bugs
  that can crash the parser.
- optimise the testing system, perhaps use another testing framework that is
  more actively maintained, test more edge cases and use macros to write clean
  tests.
- package it nicely
- implement wordlist functionality (find a space-efficient way to store large
  word lists?)
